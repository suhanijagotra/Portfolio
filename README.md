This is my portfolio.
This project utilizes a variety of web development skills and technologies to create a responsive, visually appealing, and user-friendly website. Here's a brief explanation of the key skills and technologies used:

1. **HTML**:
   - The foundational markup language used to structure the content of the website. Elements like sections, headings, paragraphs, lists, and links are defined here.

2. **CSS**:
   - **Selectors and Properties**: Basic styling for elements including margins, padding, colors, and text alignment.
   - **Flexbox**: Used extensively for layout, allowing for responsive design and alignment of elements in a flexible manner.
   - **Media Queries**: Ensure the website is responsive, adapting the layout and styles based on different screen sizes.
   - **Pseudo-classes and Pseudo-elements**: Enhance interactivity and style elements based on their state or position, such as `:hover` and `::after`.
   - **Animations and Transitions**: Add smooth changes to styles, such as hover effects and element transformations.

3. **Responsive Design**:
   - Ensures the website looks and functions well on various devices, from desktops to mobile phones, through the use of flexible layouts and media queries.

4. **Google Fonts**:
   - External fonts ("Poppins" and "Ubuntu") are imported and applied to different sections of the website, enhancing typography and overall aesthetic.

5. **JavaScript (Menu Button)**:
   - **Interactivity**: JavaScript is used to toggle the visibility of the navigation menu on smaller screens, making the site more interactive and user-friendly.

6. **CSS Grid and Flexbox**:
   - Utilized for advanced layout designs, allowing for the creation of complex and responsive grid structures and flexible box layouts.

7. **CSS Transitions and Transforms**:
   - Applied to create smooth visual effects for hover states and other interactive elements, enhancing user experience.

8. **Background Images and Gradients**:
   - Custom background images and gradients are used to provide a visually appealing design.

9. **Icon Fonts (e.g., Font Awesome)**:
   - Icon fonts are used for scalable and customizable icons throughout the website.

10. **Shadow and Hover Effects**:
    - Box shadows and hover effects are used to create a sense of depth and interactivity, making the design more dynamic and engaging.

These skills combined create a polished, professional-looking website that is both functional and aesthetically pleasing, providing a good user experience across various devices and screen sizes.
